# mctwitterbot
*This is a simple project by yours truly, [@DALTONTASTIC](https://twitter.com/DALTONTASTIC)!*

Using this simple PHP implementation you'll be able to tweet out your server's status at whichever interval you deem appropriate. Simply fill in config.php, and setup a cronjob to query tweet.php as often as you'd like to tweet. *You should probably rename tweet.php, or maybe not host it in a public directory (lmao) - unless you want somebody to spam your Twitter.*
